# Installation

> Installation guide is based on **Ubuntu**. Of course, you can use any unix-based system, but make sure that your OS supports the following commands.<br/>

To create your new AtroCore application, first make sure you're using PHP 7.1 or above and have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed.

#### 1. Create your new project by running:
   ```
   composer create-project atrocore/skeleton-pim my-atrocore-project
   ```
   > **my-atrocore-project** – project name
   
#### 2. Change recursively the user and group ownership for project files: 
   ```
   chown -R webserver_user:webserver_user my-atrocore-project/
   ```
   >**webserver_user** – depends on your webserver and can be one of the following: www, www-data, apache, etc.

#### 3. Change the permissions for project files: 
   ```
    find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} + && find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} +;
    find data custom upload -type d -exec chmod 775 {} + && find data custom upload -type f -exec chmod 664 {} +
   ```
   
#### 4. Configure the crontab as described below.

   4.1. Run the following command:
      
      crontab -e -u webserver_user
      
   4.2. Add the following configuration:
      
      * * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/my-atrocore-project/index.php cron 
      
#### 5. Create MySQL database and user. User must have all privileges for database. You can create database and user with all privileges by executing next few commands:
 
   Connect to mysql:
   ```
   mysql -u root -p
   ```
   Create database **atrocore**:
   ```
   CREATE DATABASE atrocore;
   ```
   Create user **atrocore_user** with password **atrocore_password** and grant all needed privileges:
   ```
   CREATE USER atrocore_user@localhost;
   ALTER USER atrocore_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'atrocore_password';
   GRANT ALL ON atrocore.* TO atrocore_user@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;
   ```


#### 6. Go to http://YOUR_PROJECT/ to start the installation wizard for your AtroCore Application in the web interface. Follow the instructions in the wizard.
