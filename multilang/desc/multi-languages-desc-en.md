The "Multi-Languages" module enables you to store your data in more than one language by adding to your system as many locales as needed. It also allows you to make fields of the `Boolean`, `Enum`, `Multi-Enum`, `Text`, `Varchar`, or `Wysiwyg` types multilingual for any entity in the system and assign user roles different read/edit permissions to these multilingual fields separately for each locale.

## Installation Guide 

The "Multi-Languages" module is automatically installed with [TreoCore](https://treopim.com/help/what-is-treocore), but if you do not have it, then go to `Administration > Module Manager`, find this module in the "Store" list and click `Install`:

Select the desired version in the installation pop-up window that appears and click the `Install` button. The module background will turn green and it will be moved to the "Installed" section of the Module Manager. Click `Run update` to confirm its installation.

> Please, note that running the system update will lead to the logout of all users.

To update/remove the "Multi-Languages" module from the system, use the corresponding options from its single record actions drop-down list in `Administration > Module Manager`.

Moreover, the "Multi-Languages" module is also installed together with [TreoPIM](https://treopim.com/help/what-is-treopim) and it is TreoPIM dependent, i.e. if TreoPIM is still installed in the system, the "Multi-Languages" module cannot be removed.
